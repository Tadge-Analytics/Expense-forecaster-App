# Improved-Personal-Finance-Dashboard

Oh boy, this is a much simpler, easier to follow personal finance dashboard.

I have loaded it up with some default values.

I hope it can be of some use to people (whether from a finance planning perspective or from a learning shiny/R-coding perspective).

Enjoy.

It was much easier to build on from and simplify my older (frankly, rediculously complex) finance dashboard efforts.

Key features of this one include: 
* The ability to edit the DT table within the app.
* The ability to download the DT table down to Excel and then to re-upload when you're ready.
* The ~dynamic filters are nice, as well.

I would like to improve:
* Add an instructions page
* The colours (oh man, these defaults are dreadful)
* removing the row_numbers out of the DT table (I suspect this is an easy fix)
* the ggplotly tooltips -especially the net position tooltip (no value is displayed)
* Perhaps add a few more labels at certain milestones... to make it easier to see forecast values
* I would also like to add a downloadable pdf 1 pager (that actually is a useful summarisation).

Feel free to reach out to me online.
