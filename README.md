# Improved-Personal-Finance-Dashboard

Oh boy, this is a much simpler easier to follow personal finance dashboard.
It was much easier to build on and simplify my older (frankly, rediculously complex) efforts.

Key features include editing inside the DT table.
The ability to download items table to Excel and then to re-upload when you're ready.

Filters are nice, as well.
