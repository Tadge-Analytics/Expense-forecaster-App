"Frequency" is "how many of the timeframes" the income/expense takes to occur (eg. "6" + "month" = every 6 months). 

Category levels 1 and 2 are free for you to determine

"Reference date" can be a past or "the next future" date

"Stop after" will limit the number of future transactions.

Income transactions need to have the "Income (Y)?" column marked, with a "y" or "Y". Leave this column blank for expenses.
